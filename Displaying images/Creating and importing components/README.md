## Task

You've learned that you can export a component either as a default export or as a named export. You've also learned how to import such components.

Let's demonstrate this with a basic example. In this exercise, you'll practice saving a component to its own file and importing it into its parent component so that it can be rendered on the screen.

## Instructions

### **Step 1**

Move the `Heading` function from App to a separate component file, named "Heading.js".

Also note that you can build a new file by right-clicking on the `src` folder, then in the right-click contextual menu that appears, clicking on the _New File_ command.

After you've clicked the _New File_ command, you'll need to type the file name and extension into the slot for the new file. You need to type in: _Heading.js_

Once you've typed _Heading.js_, press the ENTER key to finish the process of naming the file. Upon pressing the ENTER key, your new, empty _Heading.js_ file will be shown, ready to be edited and updated with some code.

### **Step 2**

Import the `Heading` component into the `App` component.

### **Step 3**

Remove the sentence that reads: _This is the starting code for “Your first component” ungraded lab_ - so that only the `Heading` JSX element remains in the return statement of the App component.

### **Step 4**

Save and view the app in the browser.
